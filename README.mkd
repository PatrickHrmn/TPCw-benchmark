# Purpose:A benchmarking platform to compare the different database approaches. Based on the <a href="http://www.tpc.org/tpcw/">TPC-W</a> specification it allows to compare the latency between diferent implementations. # About: Implementing all the database operations on the TPCw (11 of the 14 original) this platform includes a <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PedroGomes/TPCw-benchmark">Datanucleus Cassandra</a> functional ports of that specification. 

A basic consistency workload is also available that allows the user to mesure the efects of no ACID garanties.   
# Configuration: This database allows the use of different populating classes, database executing interfaces and workload factories. To configure the benchmark the user must edit the base Benchmark JSON file and the associated workload and database files accordingly with the context.  # Use:	-cb - Benchmark cleaning, removes the basic tables needed for execution, and can introduce fresh values. (Only functional in MySQL)		-c - Full Database cleaning.	-p - Populates the database.		-m - Execute in master mode.		-s - Execute in slave mode. # FeedbackUpdated source and an issue tracker are available at:	    https://github.com/PedroGomes/TPCw-benchmarkYour feedback is welcome.
